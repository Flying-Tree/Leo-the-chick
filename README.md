# Léo

A little game where a chick named Léo has to go to a weather vane. If you expect serious work, don't look here.

## Warning

***Tests are not sufficient : the Linux packages have been tested on only one computer (running Linux Mint 19.3 and KDE Plasma). The Windows packages have been tested on the same system using Wine. MacOS packages have not been tested.***

## System requirements

Currently, the only existing packages are for Mac and x86_64 PC. You need a screen, a mice and a keyboard. As Unity is used, the systems must comply with [the requirements of Unity Player 2020 LTS](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/system-requirements.html#desktop). If your system can be supported, you can ask me to build packages.

## Install

On PC, I guess you can just extract the package anywhere and run ```Leo.exe```
or ```leo.x86_64```(depending on your operating system) when you want to play (this might happen only once).

If you have a Mac, I provide you the ouptut of the building process, but I can't help you.

## Controles

- Escape to close the app
- WASD or the arrow keys to move, **WASD equivalents such as ZQSD do not work**, please temporarily use the QWERTY (US) layout or use the arrow keys (less convenient)
- Mouse to look arround
