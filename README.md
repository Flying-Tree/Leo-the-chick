# Leo-the-chick

A little game where a chick named LÃ©o has to go to a vane.

## Install

I guess you can just extract the package anywhere and run ```Leo.exe```
or ```leo.x86_64```(depending on your operating system) when you want to play (this might happen only once).

Mac users : I've not yet build OS X packages.

## Warning

The Linux packages have been tested on a computer running Linux Mint 19.3. The Windows packages have been tested on the same system using Wine.

## Controles

Escape to close the app

WASD or the arrow keys to move
